# FAQ

## How many photos can I post?

We know you want to show off your fabulous furry facy, so we've given you spact to upload up to 15 photos. 
For those who are camera-shy, we recommend posting at least one to bring your profile some attention. 
Showcase your best self-whether that means a fresh-from-the-groomer glamour shot or an action shot from your last game of fetch.

## Photos are nice and all, but I don’t see very well. How can I smell the other dogs?
 
We regret that we are unable to offer our customers smell-o-vision at this time. 
As soon as human technology catches up to dog noses, we’ll be sure to add a scent feature to the app. 
In the meantime, why not meet up at the dog park to get a whiff of your new friend?
